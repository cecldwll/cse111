CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    Currency Calculator

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    This program can make it quicker and easier to convert money/currency value between two countries.
    You won't have to do things like open a new tab, or type in something like 'currency exchange rate'. (Just run this program)

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    This will be an important test to help me figure out a program like this on my own. It can be a lot simpler to follow the instructions
    in our weekly assignments. This is a project that I have sought out on my own, will plan, and figure out on my own too.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    
    I will probably use math, pystest, and tkinter.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    I will definitely have multiple different functions in my program. I will probably have a function to get inputs and print outputs,
    a function to find/hold different countries/currencys/rates, and a function to do the math. Then my test programs with have different math functions and
    such to test different inputs (countries and amounts).

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
    Yes, I will be. The best way to test my skills in both program testing and program writing, is to write test functions.
